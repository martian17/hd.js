# Logic Circuit Simulator 
Object oriented logic circuit simulator.  
It can simulate stored states like SR flip flop, as well as normal one way composition operations.  
So far the most complex thing that I have built with it is a 32 bit integer adder.  
1 means 1, 0 means 0, and 2 means error in the output.  

# Major Methods
```
Gate.getOutputValues();
CompositeGate.setInputValues(array);
```

# Example
Refer to test.js
